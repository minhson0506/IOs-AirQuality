# ISP iOS application 

The indoor air quality monitoring application is designed to provide users with real-time information about the quality of the air in their surroundings. This application is able to show key indicators of air quality, such as PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels, etc. and alert to users in case of hazardous conditions. The data collected by the application is displayed in an easy-to-read dashboard that allows users to quickly identify areas of concern and take action to improve the air quality.
